# Smart-Contracts-on-OMNI-TETHER
Tools for the trustless exchange of digital to fiat currencies.

Omni Tether coins are cryptocurrencies issued manually, and each coin is backed with one unit of the conuterparty fiat currency by the means of a trust in Hong Kong.
This means that there is no limit in the issuing of these coins, and they have 1:1 parity with the fiat currency value.
This is a proper asset to exchange foreign fiat currencies with dollar or euro.

But, why would we need a crypto platform for this?... There are not enough forex exchange financial institutions?
Firstly, using banks to exchange your local currency for alien currency, affects the balance-of-payment of your country.
In horizontal transactions, there are no cross-border exchange, but just the exchange of asset between two people.

But our main goal is to help the Venezuelan merchant and the Venezuelan industrialization.
Since 2002 Venezuela is under a strong foreign exchange control of currencies, but while a senseless process of deindustrialization and expropiations of the productive infraestructure of the country was happening, in the beggining of this new decade, the legal controls over the forex exchange increased, turning the activity into a crime, punished with jail.
Nowadays, the exchange of our local currency to digital assets is on a legal void. But cryptocurrencies are being persecuted by military police of the country, without any legal basis.
As Venezuela turns into a dictatorship, the criminal laws against forex exchange reveals itself little by little as an illegitimate institution against the Venezuelan people.

People in Venezuela is starving, and fainting due to lack of medicines. There are none industries left and the only source of essential goods can only be accessed with foreign currency.

So we intend to use the tether as a clandestine way of providing the essential needs of our country, facilitating a trustless trade of this asset in exchange for our local currency.

This may be illegal in Venezuela.
But it is legitimate and we need it.
